            Thank you for creating a pull request!
            There are several commands you can add as comments to trigger builds:
            - `build-linux` - trigger all github actions Linux builds - RECOMMENDED
            - `build-windows` - trigger all github actions Windows builds
            - `build-macos` - trigger all github actions macOS builds - please use sparingly
            - `build-all` - trigger all github actions builds

            If you are making a change to the jenkins pipeline scripts then please run the following command:
            - `run-tests` - this will trigger all jenkins builds in a matrix
